# Travis CI  JavaScript Client

Welcome to **travis.js**, a Travis CI JavaScript Client that works both in your web browser and in node.js.

This is in a very early stage right now, so it's not really useful yet. If you are not here to contribute, you probably want to come back later.

A secondary purpose at the moment is getting to know the JavaScript tool chain a little better.
